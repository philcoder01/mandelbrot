# UseCase #1: Generate Mandelbrot Image for certain region

## Stakeholder
Math-Resercher

## Goal
As a Math-Researcher I want to be able to generate the Mandelbrot set for a certain 
  region, so I can investigate into interesting areas in more detail.
  
## Steps

1. He genereates a full mandelbrot set so he can pick/identify interesting regions.
2. He zooms into a interesting region to verify if the region really holds some interesting properties.
3. The region looks intesting, he generates a new mandelbrot set for the selected region he identified.
4. repeat 2 - 3 until he's satisfied.
