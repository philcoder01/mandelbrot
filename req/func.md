# Borders of the generated Set
The MandelViewer should be able to generate a set from defined borders, 
namely x-start and x-end in real-range and y-start and y-end in the imaginary part.

# Default-Range for the full mandelbrot set
The MandelViewer offers a quick access to the full set by generating a
set from `x-start=-2.0`, `x-end=+1.0`, `y-start=-1.0` and `y-end=+1.0`.

# Draw the set and colorcoding the border
The MandelViewer should draw pixels that are part of the set in black 
and pixels that are not part the set in white.
Part of the set means that after a specified amount of iterations the point
still remains in the Default-Range.

# Defining the amount of iterations
The amount of iterations the MandleViewer does can be configured by the user.

# Changing the range of the MandelViewer
The user can change the area of the Mandelbrot set that is displayed
in the MandelViewer by changing the range.
