## Color band range of the MandelViewer
The user can input which maximum and minimum values the colorband can have. Inside this 
range the values are displayed depending on the color spectrum. Below the minimum the color
is displayed as black. Above the maximum the color is displayed as deep blue. 

## Colour spectrum of the MandelViewer
The user can input how many colours should be used in the generation of the Mandelbrot set.
E.g. 2-6 colours (2 colours being from blue to turquoise and 6 being from blue to red)

## Saving the generated Mandelbrot set
The MandelViewer locally saves the image as a .PNG after finishing the calculations.
